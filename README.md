# mobx-clean-architecture-boilerplate
–ê boilerplate code for a project that is developed under "**Clean architecture**" agreements.

But it's not actually "Clean", because it uses Mobx library. But it's done especially to reduce time for developing a frontend project, because it allows for developer to use Aggregates and Entities as a domain Models in MVVM architecture without necessity of writing a separate versions of them as Models. Mobx is widely spreaded nowadays and can be connected to all modern UI frameworks, so you will be able to use or switch to any of them (React, Angular, Vue) without touching of your domain logic written with this boilerplate.

If you need a real "purity" for your domain logic you can use [that boilerplate](https://github.com/pashoo2/clean-architecture-boilerplate) instead of this one.
